# dispatch.py
#
# Serves as CDN analogue for dialing.
# As the dialing protocol is unimplemented, for demonstration purposes, handles the distribution of
# public keys to clients.
# 
# For demonstration, used to bootstrap server and client processes.
# Also provides standardization info to partipating processes (i.e. constraints and protocol specifications).
#
# README: Must be trusted for all purposes but CDN as Kudu lacks full implmentation.
